# Reformulate/Enhance Prompt

Use this command to improve the clarity, precision, and effectiveness of your prompts. A well-crafted prompt leads to better and more accurate responses from the AI.

## How to Use

Simply type `/reformulate-enhance-prompt` followed by the prompt you wish to improve. The AI will then provide suggestions or a rewritten version of your prompt.

Example:
`/reformulate-enhance-prompt "write some code for me"`

## Principles for Effective Prompts

To get the best results, consider these principles when crafting your prompts:

1.  **Be Specific:** Clearly state what you want the AI to do. Avoid vague terms.
    *   *Instead of:* "Write about dogs."
    *   *Try:* "Write a 200-word article about the benefits of owning a golden retriever, focusing on companionship and exercise."

2.  **Define the Output Format:** Specify the desired structure (e.g., bullet points, JSON, essay, code snippet).
    *   *Instead of:* "Tell me about Python."
    *   *Try:* "Provide a list of 5 key features of Python, each with a one-sentence explanation."

3.  **Provide Context:** Give the AI relevant background information.
    *   *Instead of:* "Explain this code."
    *   *Try:* "Explain the following Python code snippet, which is part of a web scraping script, and identify potential improvements for error handling."

4.  **Specify the Role/Persona:** Ask the AI to act as a particular expert or persona.
    *   *Instead of:* "Give me advice."
    *   *Try:* "Act as a senior software architect and provide advice on scaling a microservices application."

5.  **Set Constraints:** Define length, tone, style, or any other limitations.
    *   *Instead of:* "Summarize this article."
    *   *Try:* "Summarize this article in exactly three bullet points, using a formal tone."

6.  **Break Down Complex Tasks:** For multi-step requests, break them into smaller, manageable parts.
    *   *Instead of:* "Build a full e-commerce site."
    *   *Try:* "First, outline the database schema for an e-commerce site. Second, suggest a tech stack for the frontend and backend."

7.  **Use Clear Language:** Avoid jargon unless it's necessary and well-defined. Ensure your instructions are unambiguous.

## What This Command Does

When you use this command, the AI will:
- Analyze your prompt for clarity and specificity
- Identify areas where more context or detail would help
- Suggest improvements based on the principles above
- Provide a reformulated version of your prompt with enhanced precision
- Explain why certain changes were made

## Common Issues to Address

- **Vagueness:** Add specific details about what you want
- **Missing context:** Include relevant background information
- **Unclear output format:** Specify the desired structure or format
- **Ambiguous instructions:** Make your requirements explicit
- **Overly complex requests:** Break down into smaller, focused tasks

By following these guidelines, you can significantly enhance the quality of the AI's responses.
