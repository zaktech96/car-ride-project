| 0-1K | Starter (Free) | $0 |
| 1K-10K | Pro | $25-100 |
| 10K-100K | Pro | $100-500 |
| 100K+ | Enterprise | Contact for pricing |

#### Clerk Scaling

| 10K-50K | Pro | $25/month + $0.02/MAU |
| 50K+ | Pro | Scaling pricing |

#### Platform Scaling

**Railway:**

## Revenue Projections

### Pricing Model

Define your pricing strategy:

| Plan | Price/Month | Features | Target Users |
|------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Free | $0 | Basic features | Early adopters |
| Starter | $10 | Standard features | Individual users |
| Pro | $30 | Advanced features | Power users |
| Enterprise | $100+ | Custom features | Teams |

### Break-Even Analysis

Calculate when you'll break even:

**Monthly Costs**: $X (from operational costs above)
**Average Revenue per User (ARPU)**: $X
**Break-Even Users**: Monthly Costs ÷ ARPU = X users

### Growth Projections

| Month | Users | MRR | Costs | Profit/Loss |
|-------|-------|-----|-------|-------------|
| 1 | 10 | $100 | $90 | +$10 |
| 3 | 50 | $500 | $120 | +$380 |
| 6 | 200 | $2,000 | $200 | +$1,800 |
| 12 | 500 | $5,000 | $350 | +$4,650 |

## Cost Optimization Tips

### Reduce Costs

1. **Start with free tiers** - All services offer generous free plans
2. **Delay premium features** - Don't upgrade until you need it
3. **Optimize API calls** - Cache data to reduce Convex reads
4. **Batch operations** - Reduce number of database operations
5. **Monitor usage** - Set up alerts before hitting limits

### When to Upgrade

Upgrade services when:
- You consistently hit free tier limits
- You need better support
- You require advanced features
- Your revenue supports the cost

## Payment Processing Fees

### Polar.sh Fees

- **Percentage**: 5% of transaction amount
- **Example**: $10 subscription = $0.50 fee = $9.50 net
- **Volume discounts**: May be available at higher volumes

### Stripe (via Polar)

- **Credit cards**: 2.9% + $0.30
- **Total fees**: ~7.9% + $0.30 per transaction
- **Example**: $10 transaction = ~$1.09 in fees = $8.91 net
