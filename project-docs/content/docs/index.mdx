We try to provide ambitious developers with everything they need to:

1) Build startups in weeks (not months) and become a productive Technical Founder ✅ 
2) Learn AI Engineering (Foundations to building Production-Ready Agents) ✅ 
3) Creatively embed AI into Enterprise Systems ✅ 

## Who is This For?

Everything you see here is designed for developers who already have a solid foundation in Full-Stack Software Engineering:

These resources are NOT for absolute beginners.

You should have some prior coding experience and understand core Software Engineering concepts.

You should have a good foundation in both:

- Frontend Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript. React)
- Backend Infrastructure (Databases, APIs, Authentication)

## Before You Start Building

There are some important steps to complete before you start building anything:

### 1. Register Your Business

<Note>
Only required if you plan to accept payments from customers/clients.
</Note>

Follow our Parent Company Setup guide to register your business entity:

### 2. Validate Your Idea

There's nothing worse than building something that nobody wants, and wasting months of your time, energy and money.

Build only validated ideas.

We've created an `Idea Validation` guide to help you:

  />

As a rule of thumb, validation = at least 1 person is willing to pay for your product.
